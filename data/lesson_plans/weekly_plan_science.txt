**Assessment Schedule:**

*   **Science:**
    *   **Formative Assessments:** Daily observation of student participation in discussions, activities, and hands-on work. Review of student notebooks (drawings, observations, notes).
    *   **Summative Assessment:** Weekly quiz (oral or written, depending on literacy levels). End-of-unit project (e.g., creating a model, giving a presentation) to demonstrate understanding of concepts.

**Resource Requirements:**

*   **Materials:**
    *   Local plants, seeds, soil, recycled containers (plastic bottles, etc.), cardboard boxes, clay, twigs, leaves, stones, colored paper, crayons/pencils, charts (if available), pictures of animals and habitats, cloth for water filtration.
*   **Preparation Time:** 2-3 hours per week (gathering materials, preparing simple worksheets/quiz questions).

**Differentiation Strategies:**

*   **Mixed-Grade Grouping:** Utilize mixed-grade grouping for activities where collaboration and peer teaching can be beneficial (e.g., the habitat diorama project, water filtration demonstration).
*   **Tiered Activities:** Provide tiered activities based on grade level and student understanding. For example, Grade 4 students can research more complex adaptations of animals, while Grade 3 students focus on basic adaptations.
*   **Flexible Grouping:** Use flexible grouping based on skill level for specific activities.
*   **Individualized Support:** Provide individualized support to students who are struggling with a particular concept.

**Homework Plan:**

*   **Grade 3:**
    *   Draw a picture of their favorite plant and write two sentences about why they like it.
    *   Collect different types of leaves and classify them based on shape and size.
*   **Grade 4:**
    *   Research one animal that lives in a specific habitat and write a short paragraph about how it has adapted to survive there.
    *   Create a diagram of a food chain in the local environment.

**Important Considerations for Rural Indian School Context:**

*   **Language:** Be mindful of the local language and use it to support understanding. Use visual aids extensively.
*   **Cultural Relevance:** Connect the science concepts to the local environment and cultural practices.
*   **Community Involvement:** Involve parents and community members in science activities (e.g., inviting a local farmer to talk about plants).
*   **Accessibility:** Adapt activities to meet the needs of all students, including those with disabilities.
*   **Flexibility:** Be flexible with the lesson plan and adapt it as needed based on student needs and available resources.
