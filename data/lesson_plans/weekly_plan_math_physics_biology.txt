**Homework Plan:**

*   **Math Grade 9:** Practice problems from the textbook or teacher-created worksheets covering the week's topics.
*   **Math Grade 10:** More challenging problems from the textbook or teacher-created worksheets, including application-based questions.

*   **Biology Grade 10:** Research and write a short report on a topic related to the week's concepts, such as the history of genetics or the impact of evolution on agriculture.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Flexibility:** This is a flexible plan. Adjust it based on the students' needs and the available resources.
*   **Local Context:**  Continuously adapt the curriculum to the local context and use examples that are relevant to the students' lives.
*   **Student Engagement:**  Make learning fun and engaging through hands-on activities, discussions, and real-world applications.
*   **Collaboration:**  Encourage collaboration and peer teaching among students.
*   **Regular Review:**  Regularly review the material to reinforce learning.
*   **Communication:** Maintain open communication with parents and the community to involve them in the learning process.
*   **Different Learning Styles:** Be aware of different learning styles and adjust teaching methods accordingly. Use visual aids, hands-on activities, discussions, and group work to cater to different learning styles.
* **Inclusion:** Ensure all activities are inclusive and accessible to students with disabilities.
* **Safety:** Ensure safety in all activities, particularly in experiments.

This detailed plan should provide a strong foundation for effective teaching in a multi-grade classroom with limited resources. Remember to adapt it to the specific needs of your students and the available resources in your community. Good luck!
