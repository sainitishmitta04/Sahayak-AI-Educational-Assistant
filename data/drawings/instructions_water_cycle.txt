Okay, here's a set of step-by-step instructions for drawing a simple water cycle diagram on a blackboard or whiteboard, using basic shapes.

**Diagram Title:** The Water Cycle

**Materials Needed:** White chalk (main drawing), Blue chalk (water, rain), Green chalk (land), Yellow chalk (sun), Ruler (optional, for straight lines), Eraser.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**Step 1:** Draw a large, curved line near the bottom of the board.  This will represent the land.  Use green chalk if available.
- Teacher tip: Emphasize that this isn't perfectly flat. Include some slight curves to suggest hills or valleys.

**Step 2:** Draw a rectangle below the land line and color it in blue. This represents a body of water, like a lake or ocean.
- Teacher tip: Start from the bottom and expand to fill the space. Use horizontal strokes.

**Step 3:** Draw a large circle in the upper left of the board. Color it yellow. This is the sun.
- Teacher tip: Make sure the sun is large enough to be easily seen and doesn't overwhelm the land and water.

**Step 4:** Draw several upward-pointing straight lines (using white chalk) radiating from the water surface towards the sun. These represent evaporation.
- Teacher tip: Use a ruler for straight lines if desired, or draw them freehand. Explain that evaporation is water turning into vapor and rising.

**Step 5:** Draw a few curved lines in the upper middle of the board to represent clouds. These should be white.
- Teacher tip: Overlap the curved lines slightly to create a fluffy appearance.

**Step 6:** Draw small downward-pointing straight lines (using blue chalk) from the clouds. These represent precipitation (rain).
- Teacher tip: Vary the length of the lines slightly to make the rain look more natural.

**Step 7:** Draw angled lines going from the land surface back down to the body of water with white chalk. These are collection.
- Teacher tip: Be sure that these lines do not cross or overlap. They are a continuous movement of water.

**Step 8:** Draw a triangle on top of the land line. Label it "Mountains" if you like.
- Teacher tip: Mountains help emphasize the concept of elevation.

**Labels to Add:**

*   Sun
*   Evaporation
*   Condensation
*   Precipitation
*   Collection
*   Water
*   Land
*   Clouds

**Key Points to Explain:**

*   The water cycle is a continuous process. Water is always moving and changing states.
*   Evaporation is the process of water turning into water vapor. The sun provides the energy for this process.
*   Condensation is the process of water vapor turning back into liquid water, forming clouds.
*   Precipitation is when water falls back to earth in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
*   Collection is the process of water gathering in bodies of water, like rivers, lakes, and oceans, or soaking into the ground.

**Common Mistakes:**

*   Forgetting to label the diagram.
*   Drawing arrows that go in the wrong direction.
*   Making the diagram too cluttered.  Keep it simple and clear.
*   Omitting one of the key steps in the water cycle.
*   Not explaining that this is a continuous process.

**Variations:**

*   **Younger Grades:** Simplify the diagram further. Focus on the main steps: evaporation, clouds, rain, and water collection. Use only white chalk.
*   **Older Grades:** Add more details. Include groundwater (water soaking into the ground), transpiration (water evaporating from plants), and runoff (water flowing over the land). You can also show different types of precipitation (snow, hail).
*   **All Grades:** Have students come up to the board and draw a part of the cycle, or label the different components. You can make it a collaborative activity.
