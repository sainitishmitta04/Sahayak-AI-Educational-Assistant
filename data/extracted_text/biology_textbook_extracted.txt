Have you ever wondered why an elephant always gives birth only to a baby elephant and not some other animal? Or why a mango seed forms only a mango plant and not any other plant?

Given that they do, are the offspring identical to their parents? Or do they show differences in some of their characteristics? Have you ever wondered why siblings sometimes look so similar to each other? Or sometimes even so different?

These and several related questions are dealt with, scientifically, in a branch of biology known as Genetics. This subject deals with the inheritance, as well as the variation of characters from parents to offspring. Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity. Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their parents.

Humans knew from as early as 8000-1000 B.C. that one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual reproduction. They exploited the variations that were naturally present in the wild populations of plants and animals to selectively breed and select for organisms that possessed desirable characters. For example, through artificial selection and domestication from ancestral

*   A QR code
*   A diagram that includes two letters and colors, possibly showing genotypes and phenotypes.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Students should be able to define inheritance and variation.
* Students should understand that the study of these concepts falls within the field of genetics.
* Students should be able to understand that humans knew early on that sexual reproduction was a source of variation and learn of examples of artificial selection and domestication of plants and animals.
