The backlog is a list of all issues that have been identified but are not yet in active development. It's essentially a to-do list for future sprints.
A JIRA feature that provides a visual representation of key metrics and information about projects.
A large and complex issue that is decomposed into smaller stories. Should be sized for less than a release. A single Scrum of Scrums will ideally deliver an Epic
A data item in JIRA that stores information about an issue.
A query that is used to search for and display a specific set of issues in JIRA.
An issue is simply a unit of work within Jira that will be traced through a workflow, from creation to completion. It can range from representing a single unit of work, like a simple task or bug, to a larger parent work item to be tracked, like a story or an epic
A unique identifier in JIRA that is used to identify a specific issue.
A collection of issues, components, and other resources in JIRA that represent a specific initiative or goal.
A visual representation of the work in a Scrum development process, used to track the progress of sprints, stories, and tasks. A Scrum board in JIRA can display information about the status, priority, and assignee of each story and task, and can be customized to match the team's workflow.
A sprint – also known as an iteration – is a short (ideally one to weeks) period in which the development team implements and delivers a discrete product increment, e.g. a working milestone version.
A story or user story is expressed in a few short sentences, ideally using non-technical language. A story can be delivered by a single team in the context of a Sprint
A story point is an estimate of the relative complexity of a story.
A sequence of steps in JIRA that describe the life cycle of an issue, from creation to resolution.
