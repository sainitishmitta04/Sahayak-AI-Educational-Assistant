**Title:** The Case of the Missing Mangoes

**Characters:**
*   **Asha:** A curious and observant 11-year-old girl.
*   **Vijay:** Asha's older brother, interested in farming.
*   **Grandpa Dada:** A wise and experienced farmer.

**Story:**

Asha was puzzled. "Dada," she exclaimed, pointing to the mango tree, "where are all the mangoes? The flowers were so beautiful just last month!"

Dada, sitting on his charpoy, smiled. "Patience, Asha. Nature has its ways. Remember Vijay told you about the food chain?"

Vijay chimed in, "The caterpillars ate the mango flowers, Asha! Then, the birds ate the caterpillars. Snakes slithered in, hunting the birds, and perhaps a mongoose got the snake!"

Asha frowned. "So, the caterpillars are bad?"

"Not at all!" Dada chuckled. "They are part of the chain. They feed the birds, and the birds are food for other animals. It's a cycle, like your grandmother's roti making. Each thing depends on the other." He explained that the sun's energy helped the mango tree grow, making it the base of their local food chain. He explained further, that the caterpillars were herbivores, the birds were carnivores, and snakes were top carnivores. Even decomposers like fungi helped break down dead leaves returning nutrients to the soil which then helps the mango trees grow.

Asha finally understood. "So, if we got rid of all the caterpillars, the birds wouldn't have food, and maybe the snakes would go away too!"

Dada nodded. "Exactly! Everything is connected. We must respect all creatures, big and small, because they all play their part."

**Learning Points:**

*   A food chain shows how energy passes from one living thing to another.
*   Plants, like the mango tree, are usually at the bottom of the food chain.
*   Animals are either herbivores (eat plants), carnivores (eat meat), or omnivores (eat both).
*   Removing one part of the food chain can affect everything else.

**Discussion Questions:**

1.  What would happen if all the snakes disappeared from Dada's farm?
2.  Can you think of another food chain you might see in your village or town?
