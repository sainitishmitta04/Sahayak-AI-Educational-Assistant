**Common Challenges:**

*   **Word Decoding:** Difficulty decoding multi-syllabic words like "evaporates."
*   **Phrasing:** Reading word-by-word instead of grouping words into meaningful phrases.
*   **Pacing:** Reading too slowly or too quickly.
*   **Hesitations:** Frequent pauses and restarts within the sentence.
*   **Ignoring Punctuation:** Not pausing at commas or periods.

**Improvement Tips:**

*   **Repeated Reading:** Practice reading the same sentence multiple times, focusing on smoothness.
*   **Choral Reading:** Read the sentence aloud with a partner or small group.
*   **Echo Reading:** Listen to the teacher (or a recording) read the sentence and then repeat it.
*   **Sight Word Practice:** Review common sight words to improve reading speed.
*   **Marking Phrases:** Practice identifying and marking phrases within sentences to guide reading.

**Extension Activities:**

*   **Write Sentences:** Have students write their own sentences about the water cycle, focusing on using clear and descriptive language.
*   **Draw a Diagram:**  Ask students to draw and label a diagram illustrating the water cycle, connecting the visual representation to the sentence they read.
*   **Research:**  Assign students to research a specific aspect of the water cycle (e.g., condensation, precipitation) and present their findings to the class.
*   **Cloze Activity:** Provide a sentence with a word missing (e.g., Water ______ from rivers...) and have students fill in the blank with an appropriate word from a word bank.
*   **Sentence Combining:** Give two short, simple sentences about water evaporation. Have them combine into one longer sentence. For example: "Water changes. It turns into a gas." becomes "Water changes and turns into a gas."
